# [G-04] Inline the variables used only once 

Varibales that are used only once can be inlined to save some gas ,they dont need to be stored in memory as 
they are only used once 

For example : https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-ens/blob/main/contracts/dnsregistrar/DNSRegistrar.sol#L73-L77

The code can be changed from : 

modifier onlyOwner() {
        Root root = Root(ens.owner(bytes32(0)));
        address owner = root.owner();
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        _;
    }

to 

modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == Root(ens.owner(bytes32(0))).owner());
        _;
    }
