<h1> [M-01] Onlyowner modifier prevents DSCEngine contract from minting and buring the tokens </h1>

<h2>Medium Risk</h2>

<p>The functions burn and mint in the DecentralizedStableCoin contract have the Onlyowner modifier , so only the address that deployed the contract can call those functions. But these 
    functions are also called by DSCEngine , now since the DSCEngine contract doesnt deploy the DecentralizedStableCoin contract . This makes the burn and mint functions unusable 
    by DSCEngine . This will make every call to depositCollateralAndMintDsc and redeemCollateralForDsc revert and hence break the functioning
