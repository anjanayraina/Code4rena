Estimated gas saved: 80 gas 

the isAuthorized function is an internal function and is only called once and that too in a modifier. 
Consider adding the check directly in the modifier itself to prevent unnecessarily gas cost 

consider doing something like this and removing isAuthorized altogether  : 

  modifier auth() {
        require(msg.sender == owner , "ds-auth-unauthorized");
        _;
    }
