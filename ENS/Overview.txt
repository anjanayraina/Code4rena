This is kind of like the same system as seen in DNS services. The main us of this is that map human readable names like 
anjanay.eth to computer recognized identifiers like addresses , content data and hashes . It works kind of like the same way 
DNS does with heirarchal way of arranging dot seperated names with the owner having full control over the subdomains 

Top level domains are owner by smart contracts (e.g. .eth or .test) and the owner of a domain can create and configure the underlying 
subdomains as they want . For example lets say that alice owns alice.eth , she can create a subdomain pay.alice.eth and configure it 
as she wants
